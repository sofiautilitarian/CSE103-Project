Problem description:
Given two straight lines with co-efficients of the equations a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + c2
= 0 respectively, write a C function to check if the straight lines are identical or not. Incorporate 
the function in a working program. You have to pass the values of the co-efficient as parameter 
to the function and the function will print the output.
Examples:
Input: a1 = -2, b1 = 4, c1 = 3, a2 = -6, b2 = 12, c2 = 9
Output: The given straight lines are identical
Input: a1 = 12, b1 = 3, c1 = 8, a2 = 7, b2 = -12, c2 = 0
Output: The given straight lines are not identica
